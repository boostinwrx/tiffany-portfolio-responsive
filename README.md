### Gatsby Starter
#### This portfolio was built starting with the [Gatsby Starter: Mate](https://github.com/EmaSuriano/gatsby-starter-mate)

Huge thanks to [Ema Suriano](https://github.com/EmaSuriano), the creator of the beautifully made SPA Gatsby starter this portolio was built upon, check out [gatsby-starter-mate on GitHub](https://github.com/EmaSuriano/gatsby-starter-mate).

Although I'm pretty proficient using React (create-react-app), I'm relatively new to creating static apps using Gatsby, so this starter was such a timesaver so I didn't have to 're-create the wheel' making my portfolio. 

Without this starter by [Ema Suriano](https://github.com/EmaSuriano), I'd easily have weeks worth of work ahead of me, making my portfolio.

#### Currently in the works

I'm adding additional features to this portfolio, such as About Me.

In addition,  I'm currently working to create my own version of a portfolio from scratch ([see repository](https://github.com/boostinwrx/tiffanyPortfolio-gatsby-styledcomp)); utilizing Gatsby, styled-components, GraphiQL, and react-spring.
